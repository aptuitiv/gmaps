# @aptuitiv/gmaps

Gmaps makes it easier to display a Google map on a page and add markers, overlays, and other elements to it.

## Install

Download from NPM.

```bash
npm install @aptuitiv/gmaps
```

## Documentation

[View the documentation](https://aptuitiv.github.io/gmaps-docs/).

## Credit

Inspired by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

## Development

TLDR: run this to build and watch the code

```bash
npm run watch-all
```

Building and watching the code involves three parts.

1. The Javascript code
2. The CSS code
3. The local server to test the code

Run the Javascript code only with `npm run watch`.

Run the CSS code only with `npm run css-watch`.

Run the local server with `npm run site-serve`.

Run all of them at once with `npm run watch-all`. This is our recommended method of working on the code as it'll watch the Javascript, the CSS, run the local site.
